        <br> The beginning
        <br />
 
    <p id="intro">
        I was born on December 16
        <sup>th</sup>, 1991.
        <br/>I love sports and anything related to them, especially football which is my first love. You can watch some of my fine quality work in the gif to the right

         Speaking of which I am a
        <b> DIE HARD</b> Dallas Cowboys fan.
        <br />I am firm belevier that Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliot will lead us to the promised land which is a 6
        <sup>th</sup> super bowl ring
        <br /> I was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, so I am
        <del>used</del>
        <ins> reluctantly accepting</ins> the brutal winters

       <a id="BabyJ">This is my headache</a> 
     <p>Reasons why I call her my headache</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As you can see she loves playing on Daddy's Iphone</li>
        <li>She is apparently allergic to a clean house</li>
        <li>
            Any and all food must be placed on the floor
            <ul>
                <li>and on the wall</li>
                <li>and in her hair</li>
                <li>and on the dog...you get the idea</li>
            </ul>
        <li>she has a love for ripping papers that daddy carelessly lays around the house</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><hr />
    <p> One of my favoite memories growing up was taking a cruise to Ocho Rios, Jamacia and the Cayman Island.</p>
